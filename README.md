This is a fun little project where you can play around with a 3D scene featuring a cool robot and a trailer. 
You can move the robot, rotate its parts, and even switch cameras to get different views of the scene. 
It's all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the Three.js library.

## How to Run
To check out the 3D goodness, just open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser. Make sure your browser supports WebGL rendering.

## Let's Play!
Once you've got the project open, here's what you can do:
- **Switch Cameras:** Press keys 1-5 to switch between different camera views.
- **Rotate Robot Components:** Use keys R, F, Q, A, W, S to rotate different parts of the robot.
- **Move Robot:** Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the robot around.
- **Toggle Wireframe:** Press key R to switch wireframe mode on and off.

## Disclaimer
This project is just for fun and learning. Feel free to tweak it, break it, or make it even cooler!
